# Welcome !

👋 Hi, I’m Manoah, a software engineer with a curious mind and a taste for philosophy (love of knowledge).

I build digital tools that serve people, not the other way around. I’m interested in the intersections between code, culture, and conscience. This blog is where I write about what I learn, what I build, and what I believe.

You’ll find here:
- Technical articles about development, architecture, and automation
- Essays on society, power, faith, and the ethics of progress
- Occasional reflections on my journey as an Orthodox Christian and digital craftsman

I’m based in France, but I build and write for a world that’s much wider.

Welcome to my corner of the internet.
